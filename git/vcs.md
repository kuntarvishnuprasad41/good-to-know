# Version Control Systems

Author : @kuntarvishnuprasad41

## Centralized VCS

A centralized VCS is a system where all the developers in a team share a single, central repository
that contains the entire history of the project. This central repository is usually stored on a
server, and all the developers in the team access it to make changes, commit their changes, and
pull the latest changes from the server.

### Pros

- Easy to manage
- Easy to track changes
- Easy to revert changes
- Easy to collaborate
- Easy to manage access control
- Easy to manage backups
- Easy to manage versioning

### Cons

- Single point of failure
- Limited scalability
- Limited flexibility
- Limited security
- Limited control over data
- Limited control over access

## Distributed VCS

A distributed VCS is a system where each developer has a local copy of the entire history of the  
project, and each developer can make changes, commit their changes, and push their changes to a
central server. This allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and security.

### Pros

- Highly scalable
- Highly flexible
- Highly secure
- Highly control over data
- Highly control over access
- Highly fault-tolerant
